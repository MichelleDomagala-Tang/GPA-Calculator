# GPA-Calculator

The program was written in Python and calculates a student's GPA based on grades the user inputs. <br />
Cumulative GPA is calculated by: <br />
    grade points = (numerical grade) * (course weighting) <br />
    GPA = (grade points) / (total course credits taken) <br />
Where conversion between the 12-point scale and 4.0 scale was based on McMaster's conversions: https://registrar.mcmaster.ca/exams-grades/grades/#tab-2
